My first hurdle:
For whatever reason I cannot seem to run the yarn install to start my current project. And this is the 10th time in a row now that I have not been able to start a
project due to the Yarn or NPM install. This is getting annoying. However I did some "troubleshooting" and discovered how to do it. Attached are the screenshots below in
the order that I figured it out. ONWARD!
